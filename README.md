## ‚ú® Features

-   **Product Browsing:** A clean, grid-based layout to view all available groceries.
-   **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** A slide-in sidebar cart where users can add, remove, and update item quantities in real-time.
-   **Smart Cart Suggestions:** The cart intelligently recommends related items ("You might also like...") based on its contents.
-   **In-Cart Subscriptions:** Users can toggle a "Subscribe & Save 5%" option for any item directly within the cart, with the total price updating instantly.
-   **One-Click Reorder:** After a simulated checkout, purchased items are saved as "Favorites." When the cart is empty, this section appears, allowing users to re-add past purchases with a single click.
-   **Persistent State:** The app uses the browser's `localStorage` to remember past orders, ensuring your "Reorder Favorites" list is available even after closing the browser.
-   **Fully Responsive:** A seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
